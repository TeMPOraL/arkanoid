/This game is a piece of ancient history; I worked on that circa 2004./

Dump of the code (and executables) of the very first game I ever wrote - a simple 2D Arkanoid.

Not much of interest here, except maybe using StarCraft string table binary format for storing localizable text for this game
(complete with coloring parts of strings).
