This is an Arkanoid`s Tech Sheet that describes some of used data formats and utilities


String Tables - Arkanoid uses the same format, that Blizzard used in StarCraft, thus to create them I used
a program called TblPad, originally designed for StarCraft. TblPad was made by ShadowFlare [blakflare@hotmail.com];
see Readme from TblPad and credits.txt for more info.

TBL Format

WORD - number of string entries
WORD [number of entries] - offset to string
Strings

LEVEL Format

Arkanoid Level Files, a.k.a. *.alv format specification:

BYTE [4] - magic number
DWORD - level version
DWORD - verification code
DWORD - offset to End Of File
BYTE [64] - Level Name
BYTE [64] - Next level file name
DWORD - initial brick count
STRUCT BRICKDATA
{
	DWORD - Brick ID
	DWORD - Brick x position
	DWORD - Brick y position
} [initial brick count]
DWORD - Brick Override Table size
STRUCT BRICKOVERRIDETABLE
{
	DWORD - Brick Type
	DWORD - New Brick Health
	DWORD - New Brick Score
} [Brick Override Table Size]
DATA OVERRIDE STRING TABLE


OBSOLETE - USAGE OF THIS FORMAT WAS ABORTED DUE TO FEW TROUBLES
Graphics Format - Arkanoid uses simple graphics format to represent animated images. GRP format consists of
two sections - Header and Image Data.

GRP Format:

BYTE [4] - magic number
DWORD - image version ID
DWORD - verification code
BYTE [64] - original image name
DWORD - number of horizontal frames
DWORD - number of vertcal frames
DWORD - offset to beginning of image data
DWORD - offset to end of image data
=========================================
Image data - here goes everything, that is in normal graphics file - headers, etc.
