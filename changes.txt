Version 08. Alpha 2.
	Second Playable version; Alpha 1 didn`t have sounds.

	^Added Sounds and Music (got to find a better one than that from Windows Pinball :) )
	#Corrected bugs causing first sound and first music not to play/stop because of incorrect handle
	#Done few changes in Ball object so that ball particles do not stay after the end of the game.
	
	*I`m thinking about a map format, with it`s own String Table containing overriding strings and i.e.
	path to some files (overriding).

	^I feel not so good when looking at the Object Manager... got the feeling that I`ve missed some serious
	memory leaks...

	!Ball when flying down the screen can blow everythig up without stopping.

	*Background :)
